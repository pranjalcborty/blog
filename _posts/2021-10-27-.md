### [Host Based Intrusion Detection System with Combined CNN/RNN Model, 2019](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-13453-2_12)

#### Key informations
* Dataset: ADFA-LD
* Architecture: RNN (stacked CNNs with GRUs).
* Computationally efficient anomaly detection.

#### Information from the paper
* This CNN+GRU Model shows promising results over traditional GRU or LSTM.

#### Possible improvement(s)
* Encoder-decoder based models could be tried.
