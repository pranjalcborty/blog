### [Anomaly Generation Using Generative Adversarial Networks in Host-Based Intrusion Detection, 2018](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8796769)

#### Key information
* Dataset: ADFA-LD
* Architecture: Cycle-GAN
* The purpose is to detect anomalies

#### Information from the paper
* Converted existing data into images and produced synthetic anomalous data using GAN to balance the dataset
* Used MLP for classification

#### Possible improvement(s) or extension(s)
* Introducing data augmentation befor CycleGAN could be interesting
