### [LR-HIDS: logistic regression host-based intrusion detection system for cloud environments, October 2018](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12652-018-1093-8)

#### Key informations
* Dataset: NSL-KDD
* Architecture: Feature selection using Logistic Regression; Classification done using **Bagging Algorithm** (MLP, DT, Linear Discriminant Analysis)
* Targeted for cloud environments (virtual machines)

#### Information from the paper
* Important features are selected using factor without regularization, derived from Logistic Regression. (Why not p-values? Not discussed.)
* Very high accuracy than the previous works

#### Possible improvement(s) or extension(s)
* Can be applied on custom datasets and check the robustness of the technique
