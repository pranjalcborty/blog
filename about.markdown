I am working for Therap for about four years now. Therap provides documentation and reporting services to the agencies, that work with people with developmental disabilities. I am involved in developing and maintaining modules, using frameworks like Spring and JPA (Hibernate). Alongside, I have worked with Node.js to prototype webapps and build chatbots. I have proficiency in building systems using Machine Learning and Deep Learning, especially to forecast capital market movement and to process natural language, which also helped me to enhance my knowledge in Python and various popular ML/DL frameworks.

Apart from these, I like to spend my time outdoors, mostly. I often take long walks through the lanes of Gulshan-Banani, eat whatever I find edible, and buy unneccessary things. I love fishing, which I have forgotten when I did for the last time (you will understand if you've ever been in Dhaka).

### Background

I completed my Bachelor's from BRAC University in Computer Science and Engineering and did my Master's from the same place in Applied Economics. I was one of the student tutors of [Abu Mohammad Hammad Ali](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hammad-ali-7a88915/){:target="_blank"}, to assist him grading scripts and helping students regarding the course Discrete Mathematics. My undergraduate thesis supervisor was [Professor Mahbub Alam Majumdar](https://www.bracu.ac.bd/about/people/mahbubul-alam-majumdar-phd){:target="_blank"}. The Master's thesis of mine was done under supervision of [Professor Wasiqur Rahman Khan](https://www.bracu.ac.bd/about/people/wasiqur-rahman-khan-phd){:target="_blank"}.

In my university life, I was actively involved in different co-curricular activities. I was the campus lead of Firefox Club (currently Mozilla Club) in BRAC University. I was also a university appointed Student Mentor for the freshers. Apart from that, from almost the beginning of my university life, I was passionately involved with BRAC University Computer Club, to organize tech events, workshops on-campus.
